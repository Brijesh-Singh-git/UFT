UFT ---> HP Unified Functional Testing (UFT) 

Hp- UFT is functional/regression test automation tool which allows user to automate applications developed on different environments 
like windows, Web, SAP, Mainframe etc.



-------------------------------------
		Important features of UFT 
-------------------------------------

- Can automate both GUI and API based applications
-  It automates functional and regression test suites
- Can generate reports after the test execution which can be used for analysis purposes by the testing team
- UFT has various features which gives it capability to test web services and service virtualization.  
- It has the facility to execute scripts within specific interval of time using task scheduler/crone job.



-----------------------------------------------
		Operations, performed while using UFT
-----------------------------------------------

1) Plan Test ---> Involves understanding the AUT 
2) Create Test ---> Generating Test scripts using test objects.
3) Enhance Test ---> Enhancing the script to make it more versatile in terms of perforimg the operation
4) Build Test -----> Combining the relevant components from plan, create and enhance test phases. 




PLAN TEST -----> 1) Understanding AUT 
				 2) Configure Licence  -------------> Seat Licence, Concurrent Licence--->(Site Concurrent, Area Concurrent, Global Concurrent), Commuter Licence
				 3) Install and Configure Add-Ins ----> Add-In is a utility which will help UFT understand the objects present in the AUT 
													    created using multiple technologies.


CREATE TEST -----> 1) Record and Playback ----> Using record option UFT users can build automation scripts automatically without having any knowledge of scripting
				   2) Object Repository ------>  Whenever UFT captures test objects, it needs a place to keep those test objects so that they can be used later for preparing and executing test scripts.
												Object repository is a placeholder/file which stores test objectâ€™s information i.e. the name of the object, the class to which it belongs, and the properties of the UI object to identify it uniquely.
										       Types: ---> 1) Local Object Repository
														   2) Shared Object Repository
				   3) Step Generator 
				   
				   









-----------------------------------------------
			Object repository Instances 
-----------------------------------------------

 If somehow we have to make any changes in the object's property value we can go and change it inside the object repository.
 

Types ----> Design-Time Instance 
			Run-Time Instance



-- Design-Time Instances :-  Design time instance of the Object repository is the one that gets created whenever a script is recorded/when object repository is created. Below are the Design time instances

a) Local Object Repository

b) Shared Object Repository
