-Data warehousing is the process of collecting raw data or business data and turning it into information that is useful and more meaningful. 
The raw data is the records of the daily transaction of an organization such as interactions with customers, administration of finance, and 
management of employee and so on.

-Testing is very important for data warehouse systems to ensure it works correctly, efficiently and the data being populated is of the correct quality.


Q. What is Data WareHosuing?
-Datawarehousing combines data from multiple sources into one database which can be used for analysis.
-The process of ETL (Extract Transform and Load) will help in extracting data from many dissimilar sources, transform data to a standard/uniform format 
and then load into a data warehouse. 

-----------------------------
Features of Data Ware House 
-----------------------------

-Subject Oriented ----> We will get the same kind of data 
-Integrated Data -----> We get data from the multiple sources 
-Time Varient -------> Every 3-4 months the data keeps changing
-Non -Volatile ---> Data does not change every time we get the same kind of data 


--------------------------------------------
		OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) -------> any Database (Day to day Transaction)
		OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)  ------> Data Warehouse is basically called as OLAP
-------------------------------------------- 



ETL v/s Database Testing
-----------------------------------
- In database testing we need to focus on tables, relations, columns, data types etc
- IN ETL Testing we need to focus on Data only.




Data Model
------------------------------
Data Model tells how the logical structure of a database is modeled

1) Conceptual Data Model 
----> Important entites and realtionship among them 
----> No attributes are specified 
----> No keys 

2) Logical Data Model  
----> Important entites and realtionship among them
----> All attributes for each entity are specified 
----> Define Keys 
3) Physical Data Model 
----> Displays all the table and columns 
----> Displays keys 
----> Data Types

	  Entity = Table 
	  Attribute = Column 


Terminologies	  
------------------------
1) Table --> Collection of rows and columns
2) Fields --> COlumns
3) Schema ---> Schema is a collection of entites(tables and their relationship)


Types of Schemas(only for data-warehouse)
-----------------
1) Star Schema 
------> All the tables belongs to a fact table (main table in middle) and dimensional tables around it.
------> In fact table every column is a primary key and the corresponding column in the dimensional table should be foreign key.


2) Snowflake Schema 
-----> It is a extension of Star Schema 
-----> 	A snowflake schema is a multi-dimensional data model that is an extension of a star schema, 
		where dimension tables are broken down into subdimensions.
